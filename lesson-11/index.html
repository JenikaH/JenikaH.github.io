            <h2>Your neighborhood deer are gearing up for winter – Get ready</h2>
            <p><i>NewsUSA – </i></p>
            <p>Like many mammals, deer physically prepare for winter by better insulating their bodies. In
                the fall, deer gradually trade their summer coats for a warmer winter one, which is more substantial and
                has thicker, longer, darker hair called "guard hairs" to protect their fur and skin from rain and
                snow.Their winter coat naturally absorbs more sunlight and traps more body heat than their warm-weather
                coat, which provides an exceptional amount of protection from the cold. Deer also have oil-producing
                glands in their skin that help make their hair, water resistant, which is especially valuable in the
                snow. For even further insulation, their bodies naturally begin to retain more fat in winter, for even
                more protection.Deer alter their behavior to survive the harsh winter weather. They generally become
                less active, sometimes dropping their metabolism by half, which allows them to save energy. Deer can
                hunker down during particularly harsh winter weather and survive on their fat, but eventually they have
                to eat something, although their preferred food sources are long gone.Although amazing, deer do survive
                harsh winters when the vegetation they prefer is nearly impossible to find. Deer’s usual winter diet
                includes food that is not particularly nutritious, but it’s above the snow and available to feed on,
                like twigs, leaves, bark and evergreen shrubs and trees like yews and arborvitae. Arborvitae is a
                popular tree and a common backyard hedging solution that grows moderately fast and looks pretty around
                the perimeter of any yard. During a harsh winter, deer can decimate arborvitae trees, turning them into
                trees that look like lollipops!Because food is so scarce during winter and high deer populations mean
                more competition for food, deer are likely to be more resistant to efforts to repel them. <p>They’ll return
                to areas, like your yard, where they found plentiful pickings in warm weather and be more inclined to
                stay put until your yard is stripped clean of all possible food sources. A single adult deer eats about
                7 pounds of food a day and does usually occupy the same 3- to 4-square-mile area for their entire lives.
                That means if you’ve had deer in your yard before, it is more than likely your yard is already on their
                list to forage food this winter, so your shrubs and trees – your most expensive landscaping- is at risk
                this winter.To save your shrubs and trees from deer damage in winter and strike a blow against deer’s
                voracious appetites you’ll need a reliable, proven effective solution that’s easy to use in the cold
                months of winter. Your best defense against deer is the continual use of a proven-effective repellent,
                like easy-to-use Bobbex Deer Repellent, foliar spray. The product is an environmentally friendly,
                nontoxic and long-lasting deer deterrent that’s safe for people, pets, wildlife and aquatic life.
                Ingredients include putrescent eggs, fishmeal, fish oil, garlic, and other natural ingredients – all
                materials that offend a deer’s sensitive sense of smell and taste.</p><a href="https://www.copyrightfreecontent.com/community/your-neighborhood-deer-are-gearing-up-for-winter-get-ready/">Read More!</a><br>
